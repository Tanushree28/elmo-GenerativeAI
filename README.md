# elmo-GenerativeAI

We are facing an issue in benchmarking. We tried to fit our model in the Hugging face available Elmo but since this model is not of hugging face it shows an error.

We tried to fit out the model in the AllenNLP pre-trained model which we can find here: https://allenai.org/allennlp/software/elmo but still got some error.
